--------------------------
Task Description:

Create a program that will perform the following tasks:

    1. Greet or welcome the user to the app
    2. Ask the user for entering username and password
    3. Check whether the password and username entered are among those registered.

        The registered username - password pairs:
        | USER |   PASSWORD  |
        -----------------------
        | bob  |     123     |
        | ann  |    pass123  |
        | mike | password123 |
        | liz  |    pass123  |

    4. Ask the user to select among the three texts stored in the variable TEXTS.
    5. Calculate the following statistics for the selected text:
        number of words in total
        number of words starting with capital letter
        number of uppercase words
        number of lowercase words
        number of numeric-only words (e.g. 100, not 100N)
    6. Create a bar chart depicting the frequencies of word lengths in the text. For example:

        1 * 1
        2 *********** 11
        3 *************** 15
        4 ********* 9
        5 ********** 10

        In the above chart, there is one word of length 1, 11 words of length 2, 15 words of length 3 etc.

    7. Calculate the sum of all the numeric "words" in the given text.
